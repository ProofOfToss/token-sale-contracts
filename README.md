# Solidity smart-contracts for Proof of Toss token sale

## Requirements

* Solidity >= 4.0.18

## TODO

* Add operator deposit amount blocking/unblocking functions to TossToken smart-contract
* Add Solidity unit tests

## How to deploy

Any possible options to compile and deploy contracts will work. You could use any of available ways to do it:

* e.g. compile via [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) (choose Solidity 4.0.19 and check the optimization option) and deploy via [MyEtherWallet](https://myetherwallet.com/)
* or integrate these contracts into Truffle box - this is the way we have chosen (info is below)

## Truffle Sandbox

Smart-contracts are integrated into our Truffle sandbox: https://github.com/ProofOfToss/token-sale-sandbox

It is possible to compile and deploy token sale smart-contracts to testrpc or mainnet/testnet with it.

Please read carefully the instructions in [Truffle sandbox repository](https://github.com/ProofOfToss/token-sale-sandbox)!
